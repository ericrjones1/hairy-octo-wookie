An attempt to generate code loosely based upon the book

**Professional PHP Design Patterns** by *Aaron Saray* and produced by *Wiley Publishing*
  
There have been many posts in the forums about getting the source code for parts of the book.  
As such, I have taken this project on as a form of learning and admiration.
  
I am loosely basing my code on the examples presented in the book.  For those who
have read the book should hopefuly see the similarities, but appreciate the differences.

In addition, I am attempting to use a more abstracted approach with a modern twist.
Such as using *interfaces*, *abstract classes*, *namespaces*, and tools (*Composer*, and *PHPUnit*).
