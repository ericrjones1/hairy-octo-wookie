        <h1>HairyOctoWookie</h1>
        <p>An attempt to generate code loosely based upon the book</p>
        <p><strong>Professional PHP Design Patterns</strong> by <em>Aaron Saray</em></p>
        
        <p>There have been many posts in the forums about getting the
        source code for parts of the book.  As such, I have taken this 
        project on as a form of learning and admiration.</p>
        
        <p>I am basing my code on the examples presented in the book; however,
        I am attempting to use a more abstracted approach with a more 
        &quot;modern&quot; twist (i.e., using Composer, and PHPUnit).</p>
